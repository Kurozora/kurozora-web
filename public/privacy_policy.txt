We want to ensure that you have a pleasant time on our platform. If you decide to register an account with us, we will have to store some data to keep track of your account and your details. Your privacy is very important to us, so we will always process your personal data with the utmost care.

It is your data, after all. Your privacy comes first for us:

We secure your data properly and only use them for our services. We will not share your data with third parties, unless we have received your explicit permission.

- Choice and control
We give you the option to be forgotten and removed from our entire infrastructure. You can request this by reaching out to an administrator.

- Innovative
We will always try to improve our infrastructure to protect your data even better and we are always open to suggestions from our community.

What information do we collect/store?

We, self-evidently, have to store all information that you enter during the registration process. Other data may also be linked to your account, like a profile picture or biography. The information tied to your account is used for different purposes on our platform. For example:
- allowing you to login to our platform
- interacting on our platform on your behalf (once you are signed in)
- displaying your profile page
- etc.

Next to your account data, we also store data related to your logged in sessions. We have to store this information to allow you to authenticate on our platform. This data may consist of:
- the type of device that authenticated
- the software/operating system and/or version of the device
- the IP address of the authenticated client
- authentication data and session expiry date
- etc.

We may use a third party provider, "IP Info" (https://ipinfo.io/), to resolve your IP address to a geographical location. This information may consist of:
- approximate city
- approximate region
- country
- approximate coordinates (latitude/longitude)

The geographical locations are stored on our servers and bound to an individual login session.
We have picked "IP Info" with care, but what they do with your IP address is beyond our control. You can read their privacy policy here: https://ipinfo.io/privacy-policy.

We also keep track of IP addresses that have made failed login attempts. We do this to temporarily "block" IP addresses from logging in once they have done this too many times.

As a user of our platform, we have to store your Anime library. This library may consist of Anime items (if you decide to use this feature). We keep track of your library for your personal purpose. Your library information will not be shared, unless we get your explicit permission to do so.

How do we ensure safety of data?

We take different precautions to ensure that the data we collect is stored safely. Our server is protected with an SSL-certificate, which means that traffic from your device to our server is encrypted.

User passwords are always encrypted and are not readable by anyone. Not even a full-access administrator.

We do our very best to try to protect your data as much as we can. But as with any other infrastructure, we cannot be 100% bullet proof. This is why we cannot guarantee that our server will never be breached. In the case of a data-leak or server breach, we will do our best at informing every single affected user as soon as possible.

Your control over your information

You are always welcome to message a platform administrator with questions regarding your data and/or account. We will be happy to help you deactivate/remove your account if you absolutely want this.

If you feel that we are not abiding this privacy policy, please reach out to an administrator immediately.

* We retain the right to modify this privacy policy at any moment. It is your responsibility to keep up to date with the latest changes.
