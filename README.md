[Kurozora](https://kurozora.app) is your one-stop shop for everything anime! The Kurozora website powers both the website and the API of Kurozora. It gives you access to the huge catalog of anime, manga and games. It is designed to be:

* **ðŸ’¨ Fast.** No clutter, no bloat, no complex dependencies. The Kurozora API is built with Laravel, one of the fastest PHP frameworks.

* **âœ¨ Beautiful.** The codebase is carefully designed to be consistent and intuitive. By utilizing Laravel's features as much as possible, we prevent reinventing the wheel and writing spaghetti code.

* **ðŸ§ª Tested.** The team strives for a 99.9% test coverage. By combining PHPUnit and Laravel, we are able to write expressive, fast and insightful tests.
