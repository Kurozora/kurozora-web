## About Kurozora

**[Kurozora](https://kurozora.app/) is your go-to platform for tracking, sharing and discovering Anime and much more!** `kurozora-web` is the server side behind Kurozora. It is designed to be:

* **ðŸ’¨ Fast.** No clutter, no bloat, no complex dependencies. The Kurozora API is built with Laravel, one of the [fastest](http://www.phpbenchmarks.com/en/benchmark/laravel/5.8) PHP frameworks.

* **âœ¨ Beautiful.** The codebase is carefully designed to be consistent and intuitive. By utilizing Laravel's features as much as possible, we prevent reinventing the wheel and writing spaghetti code.

* **ðŸ§ª Tested.** The team strives for a 99.9% test coverage. By combining PHPUnit and Laravel, we are able to write expressive, fast and insightful tests.
