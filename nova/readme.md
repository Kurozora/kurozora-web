## Upgrade Guide

- Copy the `Main` dashboard to your codebase
- Delete the `cards` method from your `NovaServiceProvider`
- Action `fields()` method changed to `fields(NovaRequest $request)`

### Modals

If you have a custom modal, make sure to add the `<teleport to="#modals">` component as the root level.
